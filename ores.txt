These are the ores that player can mine -
Iron 
Coal
Copper
Gold
Aluminum 
Plutonium
Zinc
Diamond
Lead
Lithium


These are the prices that the tradeHub will pay for the raw ores
Tron    = 15
Coal    = 5
Copper  = 40
Gold    = 100
Aluminum    = 20
Plutonium   = 80
Zinc    = 10
Diamond = 120
Lead    = 30
Lithium = 80

These are the prices that the tradeHub will pay for the refined ores
reinforced Iron    = 45
reinforced Coal    = 15
reinforced Copper  = 120
reinforced Gold    = 400
reinforced Aluminum    = 60
reinforced Plutonium   = 240
reinforced Zinc    = 30
reinforced Diamond = 360
reinforced Lead    = 90
reinforced Lithium = 240

With some factorys you will be able to combine ores into new materials to get even higher prices
